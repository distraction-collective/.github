## Distraction Collective

Distraction is a Paris-based collective of artists and designers delving into the intricate interplay between consciousness and contemporary imaginaries through the non-linear use of real-time technologies and video games. We believe in transdisciplinary approach, seamlessly blending practice, research, and experimental play in order to reach collective emancipation.

This is the github organization centralizing all of our content.
